## Hyper Text Markup Language
    * HTML is the structure for webpages using semantic tags
    * Create Blocks of content for the layout of your site
    * Only focus on the text and structure, not fonts, colors,...






<p> paragraph 
<img> is an image 
<em> when you want to emphasize a word, the browser will show the word in italicazed.  
<strong> will bold the text 
<br> is a break in text 
<ul> unordered list, no numbers, just bullets 
<ol> ordered list, will use numbers, still need to us <li> 
<li> list item 
<div> group items together, but becomes difficult to maintain organization
<title> is what will be displayed in the webiste browser name, not on the site

moving a line of code by highlighting your code, select alt and use up/down arrows

Selectors
 - class
    - <h1 class="specificName">text you want in header 1</h1> in html
    - .specificName{} in CSS
 - ID
    - <h1 id="specificName">text you want in header 1</h1> in html
    - #specificName in CSS

link to CSS file should be placed

link to JS can be placed in the footer of html to allow the html website to load before prompts














































Other more specific tags are better at organizing 

Section is on for the body of the web page 

Article is a combination of a header, image and text 

Whitespace may or may not matter depending on the language 

Uppercase/lowercase does not matter  

Layout 

First column is to say what program you are using = <html> 

Second column is to say what part of the website you are in 

Body 

Head 

 

Editor Software 

The software to write code 

Repl.it is a software that allows you to write the code without downloading the software 

Index.html is the webpage name 

Comments 

<!-- insert comment here --> 

Notes you can write to yourself, use a command that the language will ignore. The tag will be different for each language 

Ctrl + / is a shortcut 

<!----> is the tag for personal notes where the code will be ignored. 

Prioritizing 

Use numbers to priortize order of headers 

H1 is the top header of the page 

Browsers have default info to show the size from h1 to h2 

<head> vs. <header> 

Head Is the main part of the webpage 

No visual output on the page, just information about the website 

Header is the top of the webpage 

Symantic 

Tags that give meaning, purpose 

Block vs Inline 

Block tags will affect layout 

Body, main, img 

Inline tags will not affect layout 

Bold, italic 

Article 

<article> 

Lists 

<ul> unordered list 

<li> list item, adds a bullet point to each list item 

Links - external sites 

<a href=”http://......”>Click here for more information 

Click her for more information will be the text that is showed that has the hyperlink embedded 

Links – internal site 

Add an id to the section you want to link to 

Example : <h2 id=”bananas”>Bananas</h2> 

Then go to where you want the link to be created and a link using <a href”#bananas”>Bananas 

You need to add a # before the name 

Image 

<img src=”add file here”> 

Width 

Add width=”and number” after the image script 

Alt text 

Adds text to images when people that can’t see well are viewing webpages 

Add alt=”this is an image of....” 

Don't need closing brackets on images 

Source 

Src=””  

Public domain photos 

Unsplash website 

Download photo to computer 

Select 3 bar icon to upload image 

HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language 

HTML will only be the text of a website. CSS will change how the text looks 

Element 

Code that is inside two brackets <> 

Example <body>, </body> 

Element has two tags 

Opening tag: <body> 

Closing tag: </body> 

<p>, </p> is a paragraph of text 

These tags are not needed if you are only using one paragraph of words in that section 

If you want to have multiple paragraphs, you will need to enter <p> </p>, multiple times around each paragraph 

<title> is what will appear as the website name in the browser window 

<h> Headings 

<h1> is the main heading 

If you want to have multiple sections have the same format you can use <h2> multiple times 

Using <h3> will look different than <h4> by default 

<b> Bold 

<i> Italic 

<sup> superscript, example for trademark ™ 

<sub> subscript , example H2O 

 

Empty Elements : do not have text into between the tags 

<br /> line break 

<hr /> Horizontal rule creates a horizontal line between the words 

 

White space collapsing 

Regardless of how much blank space is between each word of code, HTML will only separate the code by one space on the browser 

Table 

<table></table> 

Head of the table = <thead></thead> 

Row = <tr></tr> 

Head of the columns = <th></th> 

Body = <body> 

Item = <td>
