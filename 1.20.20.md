Adding a audio file
    - create an HTML audio tag
        - <audio id="cats" src="videos/cats.m4a" controls autoplay></autoplay>
        - ``control autoplay`` will automatacially play
        - ``muted controls`` will play, but will muted at first
    - Can add a button to interact with the audio file using <button id>
    - create js var volume = document.getElementById('audoButton');
    - Create an event listener
        - volume.addEvenetListner

Adding a video file
    - HTML create a ``<video src=""></video>``
        - adjust the controls 
        - ``poster`` is able to have an image on the video as the first image instead of the first screen shot of the video
    - JS 


Goats
 - 1) variable will be used to determine when an image is clicked on
    - ``var goatParent = document.getElementById('goats')`` want to know if either of the pictures are clicked
    - ``var leftGoat ....`` to know if the left image is selected
    - ``var rightGoat ...``
- 9) create a variable so that the indexes are increased trhoughout the array during each occurrence
    - ``var leftindex = null;``
    - ``var rightindex = null;``

12) global variable to keep track of how many rounds of votes. Lab limit of 25, but test at 5 or something smaller
    - ``var goatVotes = 0;``
    - ``var 

 - 4) Constructor function - to create
    - ``function Goat(name, image){`` need to know the name and the source of the image
        ``this.name = name;`` this.property = value;
        ``this.image = image;``
        ``this.clicked = 0;` want to keep track of how many times this goat is clicked and viewed. Start at 0, then will ++ everytime the constructor goes through each goat
        ``this.views = 0;``
        ``Goat.allImages.push(this);``creating an array by pushing the images

 - 8) Random number function to get a new random picture to populate
    - ``function rndomGoat (){``
        ``var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * Goat.allImages.length)`` go through goat.allimages array and get a random number
        ``return randomNumber;``
    }


 - 3) Clicking function, to keep track of which image was selected
    - console.log to keep track of which
    - ``var handleClickOnGoat = function (event){`` variable is pointing to a place in the memory of the site where each instance is recorded
        ``console.log(event.target.id)``
   6)     ``var goatClicked = event.target.id;`` creating a tracker for each time each goat is clicked
        
    13)  ``if goat left || goat right        `` to only calculate if they select an image, not the space in between the images     
        ``if(goatClicked === 'goatleft){``
            ``sassyGoat.clicked++``
            ``leftGoat.src = Got.allImages[randomGoat()].image;`` going through the random goat and sending it to the leftgoat
        ``} else if (goatClicked === 'goatRight)``
            
    10) render goats , don't want duplicate goats and repeats
        ``function renderGoat (){``
        confirm the goats are not the same
           `` do { ``
              `` leftIndex = randomGoat();``
               ``rightIndex = randomGoat();``

            ``} while (leftIndex === rightIndex)`` keep running if they are duplicates

        ``goat.allImages `` keeps track of how many times the item has been viewed

        ``goatleft.src = Goat.allImages[LeftIndex]`` sets the image for each images left/right
        ``goatRight.src = Goat.allImages[]``
        ``}``        
    ``}``
    ``console.log(sassyGoat);``to see how many times this goat comes through the constructor and is clicked and viewed.
 
 - 7) create the array for the goats, that is populated everytime the constructor runs
    - ``Goat.allImages = [];``

 - 5) Instantiatie each : repeat for each instance of the goat you want to run through your constructor
    - ``new Goat ('Sweater Goat', 'img address')`` need to repeat for each instance
     - ``console.log(sweaterGoat);`` to see each occurrence in your console
      - ``console.log(Goat.allImages);`` to see all occurrences of goats in your console

14) if (goatVotes === totalRounds) I don't know what is going on now


11) render goat();


 - 2) EventListner, needs to be at the bottom of the page. when the user 'click', the handleClickOnGoat function will run. But that function must be defined before
    - ``goatParent.addEventListener('click', handleCickOnGoat)``
