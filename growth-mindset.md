## Growth Mindset
    * Acknowledge fear: There is no growth in a comfort zone and no comfort in a growth zone.
    * Perserverance: Effort is the only thing stopping you from success.

## Remember
    1. Failure is an opportunity to learn.
    2. Feedback, positive or negative, is an opportunity to learn
    3. Others success is an opportunity to learn
