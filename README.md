### Growth Mindset
 * _Acknowledge fear_: There is no growth in a comfort zone and no comfort in a growth zone.
 * _Perserverance_: Effort is the only thing stopping you from success.
 

#### Remember:
1. Failure is an opportuntity to learn.
2. Feedback, positive or negative, is an opportuntity to learn.
3. Others success is an opportunity to learn.
