Need to focus: object literals
return Math.floor(randomNumber); floor will round the decimal down. __return__ will ???
__Consturctor__
    - arguments are within ()
    - variables are this.name
    - .push will add this number into this array
    - += will equal itself plus the other item. this.dailyTotals += this.hourlySales[i];

__constructor vs. method__ ???


__Instances__ __instantiating__
var seattleStore = new SalmonCookies('Seattle', 23, 65, 6.3)
    - taking these arguments and make them = to var SeattleStore
    - storeLocations.push(seattleStore, tokyoStore,....) will take the previous var seattleStore and add it to the the storelocations global variable array.
``var seattleStore = new SalmonCookies('Seattle', 23,65,6.3);``

__global array__ will be where the output of the instances are stored, but this will be stored at the top of the code given it is global
``var storeLocations = [];``


__render elements to each other__
 - is to append items to together 
 - function renderHeader(){}

__append__
    - append is for an element
        - var headerTotal = document.createElement('th')
    - string is just use =
        -example: headerTotal.textContent = 'Store Total';
    - .textContent is saying you are creating a text/string

__prototypes__
 - making the body of the table, the prototype will just make one store...used as a function so that it can be used over and over again

 __nested for loops__
  - var totalHourlySales = 0; inside the for loop will reset back to zero after every loop through the for loop. The grand total will be outside the for loop, but still inside the function renderFooter(){}.

  __render the body elements together__
    ``renderHeader();``
    ``for (var i = 0; i < storeLocations.length; i++){storeLocations[i].body();}``
    ``renderFooter();``

__form and events__
 - create the link between HTML and JS
 ``var form = document.getElementById('Store-Name');``
 - need type of event and then a function to run
 ``form.addEventListener('submit', handleSubmit)``
 - button must be inside the form:
 ``<form id="Store-Info">``
    ``<input name="storeName" type="text">``
    ``<button type="submit">Submit</button>``
 - Event is a parameter inside the function handleSubmit
    ``form.addEventListener('submit', handleSubmit)``
    ``function handleSubmit(event){}``
 - insert the new p into the function??
  - don't use - to seperate words, use camelCase
  - getting information from a form??? put this in your function within js.
  ``var minCust = parseInt(name, minCust, 65, 6.3)``
 - remove default in first line of function
    - ``event.preventDefault()``
 - how to render to the DOM
 - need to remove all the elements and re-render when you are adding a new location by selecting the submit button. add push within you handleSubmit function ...???
 -  Create a ``render();`` inside the function and outside the function ....????
 - ``tableBody.innerHTML = null;`` will help clear out the previous data in the table???? 


JavaScript
<!-- we grab our element from the DOM-->
``var form = document.getElementById('Store-Name');``

<!-- we assign an event listernr of type 'submt', to our form element, and passing in a function.....--> need notes from lecture
``form.addEventListener('submit', handleSubmit)``

``function handleSubmit(event){}``needs more code from lecture


HTML
``<form id="Store-Info">``
    ``<input name="storeName" type="text">``
    ``<button type="submit">Submit</button>``
